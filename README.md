Web app for generating and printing random sudoku puzzles

ASP.NET web application designed for generating and printing random sudoku puzzles. The made from scratch algorithm fills the empty sudoku puzzle grid with non-colliding values and then randomly removes them, based on chosen difficulty (easy: 3 to 6 values per large cell, medium: 2 to 5 values per large cell and hard: 1 to 4 values per large cell). The solution of generated sudoku can be shown by clicking "Solution" button. Generated puzzles can also be printed (by conversion to PDF file) with or without the solution.
